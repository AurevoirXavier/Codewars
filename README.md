All kata done with **Rust**.

I wrote my **thinking(tips)** in the `README.md` which under the relevant kata's folder. Hope it can help you or give you some inspiration. 

Each folder is a **cargo** project. You can simply test your data by adding a `fn main() {}` in `lib.rs`. (Tips: There isn't a `main.rs` file, `cargo run` will not work. Please using `rustc` or `touch` a `main.rs` and make the function which in `lib.rs` pub)

Warning: Many kata was **related** to some mathematical theories. I won't **elaborate** or **prove** those theories.
