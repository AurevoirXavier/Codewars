All kata done with **Rust**.

I wrote my **thinking(tips)** in the `README.md` which under the relevant kata's folder. Hope it can help you or give you some inspiration. 

Each folder is a **cargo** project. 

You can simply test your data by adding function(s) in `lib.rs`, don't forget to add `#[test]` over it.

Warning: Many kata was **related** to some mathematical theories. I won't **elaborate** or **prove** those theories.
